                <li><strong>Type:</strong> Supermassive black hole</li>
                <li><strong>Key Features:</strong> Located at the center of the Milky Way galaxy, Sagittarius A* has a mass equivalent to about 4.1 million suns. Its presence is inferred from the orbits of nearby stars, which move rapidly around an unseen object. Research continues to uncover more about this enigmatic black hole.</li>
                <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> In 2018, astronomers captured the first-ever image of a black hole’s event horizon, providing visual evidence of these mysterious objects!</li>

                <li><strong>Key Features:</strong> The M87 black hole became the first black hole to be imaged in 2019, revealing a shadow surrounded by a glowing accretion disk. This groundbreaking achievement marked a significant milestone in astrophysics and enhanced our understanding of black holes.</li>
                <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> The image of the M87 black hole was created using data from a network of radio telescopes across the globe, known as the Event Horizon Telescope!</li>

                <li><strong>Key Features:</strong> One of the first black hole candidates identified, Cygnus X-1 is part of a binary star system. It emits X-rays as material from its companion star is drawn into it. This system provides valuable insights into the formation and behavior of black holes.</li>
                <li><strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Cygnus X-1 was famously debated by physicist Stephen Hawking and fellow scientist Kip Thorne, with Hawking arguing against its existence in the early days of black hole research!</li>

                Fun Fact: The Sun has an enormous mass of approximately 1.989 × 10^30 kilograms (1.989 nonillion kg), 
                but in comparison, some black holes formed from massive stars can be up to 10 times as dense in a much smaller space. 
                Supermassive black holes, like the one at the center of the Milky Way, can contain the mass of millions of suns!
